GSoC 2014 project - D3-based Bio4j data model visualization

Student: Carmen Torrecillas
Organization: Bio4j
Mentors: @eparejatobes, @laughedelic, @evdokim

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
el-grafo is the first development of an interactive web-based tool that allows users to intuitively explore the Bio4j domain model, getting details about how vertex and edges are shaping the network as well as precise typing information.

Its purpose is to help users on their understanding of the Bio4j structure in order to manage and query it on an easier and more efficient way.




TECHNOLOGY
In terms of technology, both open-source JavaScript libraries [d3.js] for visualization and dagre/dagre-d3 graph... ...componen.. the main core.

The project consists in a Intro.html and Main.html pages, accompanied by several scripts, the data files from the model database and a external css style file. The directory layout is the following:

el-grafo-directory
- el-grafo_Intro.html
- el-grafo_Main.html
- scripts
    + lib
    + alg
- data
- css

On the sript folder there are
Apart from the main d3 and dagre/dagre-d3 libraries mentioned before, the sripts folder contains some algoritms from graphlib, a contextmenu jQuery plugin (http://www.trendskitchens.co.nz/jquery/contextmenu/)

ContextMenu is a lightweight jQuery plugin that lets you selectively override the browser's right-click menu with a custom one of your own.



INSTRUCTIONS
....
The latest browser-ready scripts could be found on their github repositories:
d3
dagre
dagre-d3

All scripts are loaded on the HTML pages with
<script src="http://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js"></script>
<script src="http://cpettitt.github.io/project/dagre-d3/latest/dagre-d3.min.js"></script>
As the API may change over the time, a copy of the libraries are included on the sripts folder.

ABOUT------

>>> ABOUT THE MODEL DATA.

...........
HTTP-service for exploring the Bio4j domain model

More info about this feature [here](https://github.com/bio4j/model-service)
 returning JSON objects of the different modules.

Get the model data in json from a service
adapt (if needed) the service data to graphlib
use the graphlib graph as input for dagre-d3
link between the layout and the represented graph

>>> ABOUT THE NETWORK LAYOUT AND REPRESENTATION. 

Network structures are usually represented by plotting x, y coordinates as attributes of the nodes, or by applying any "force-based" algorithm, based on repulsive/attractive forces and a canvas gravity. 

A set of tools and libs for graph data manipulation and representation where explored in order to find the most suitable solution for the Bio4j database model visualization.

On first place, d3.js JavaScript library has its own [Force Layout](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Force-Layout) for visualizing networks. It performes physical "forces" to arrange the elements and gives attributes to the nodes (x and y coordinates, weight..) and links (source and target nodes). Althought a flexible and interactive way of visualizating networks, it was decided that it was not suitable for this project as it mixes the layout and the representation all together, and due its dynamic nature?? because of the physics behind it would make it difficult in terms of ussability.

Other very interesting open-source JavaScript libraries consulted where [cola.js](http://marvl.infotech.monash.edu/webcola), a constraint-Based Layout in the Browser that works with d3.js, or [joint](https://github.com/DavidDurman/joint) for diagramming interactively.

The final election regarding the layout side of the project was to integrate the graph data lib [dagre.js](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre) as the most tidy and simple way to lay out the network. It has [graphlib](https://github.com/cpettitt/graphlib) bundle on it to provide data structures for undirected and directed multi-graphs along with algorithms that can be used with them. 

In our case, Digraph represents a directed multigraph

On the redenring side, it was decided to use [dagre-d3.js](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre-d3), the d3-based rendered for dagre.js on the client-side.

DESCRIPTION----------


INTRO PAGE
First approach to the Bio4j Database representation and main aspects.

Elements included:
	- General info of the project: the Bio4j Database, the Visualization project, description, what's for, credits...
	- Modules Schematic representation. Their size it is relative to the number of types (vertex and edges) of each module.
	- Textual description of each Module on hover.

	- Selection of the Modules and Dependencies between them that could be explored on click.


Visual representation into the Modules Graphical scheme.
Textual description of each dependencies.
"Access to the Network" button -> The network will be loaded with the selected Modules (the selection could be changed afterwards).



About MODULES and DEPENDENCIES
The Bio4j database is modular and customizable, allowing users to import just the data they are interested in. 




Thereâ€™s however one thing that you have to keep in mind, you must be coherent when choosing the data sources you want to have included in your database. 


There are some modules that need others to be present in the database before importing them. 

For that I created this simple schema showing the dependencies among the current modules:

About DEPENDENCIES
From the user interests it seems important not just one direction A->B (A depends on B), but also the other way (B is connected with all those other things).

MAIN PAGE
Basic network exploration of 



1. Graph filtering actions via Contextual Menu.

 will allow to perform specific graph actions (filtering by successors, predecessors, neighbors, etc) 

Some graphlib Digraph functions used: inEdges, outEdges, filterNodes...
graphlib alg modules: 


*Note1
To be implemented with t
Filtering test: test digraph.filterNodes(f) to make a copy of the diagraph that only includes the vertex/edges based on a filter function. That will allow a more interactive exploration of the graph.





2. Graphical representation of ARITY possibilities:
many/many, many/one


3. Each vertex/edge specific information on hovering (id and properties)
Display a text element as label of each node showing its id and properties.
