About dependencies:
- Very important. From the user interests is important not just one direction A->B (A depends on B), but also the other way (B is connected with all those other things).

About ways of exploring the graph:
- Focus on local exploration
- Search text is also interesting but need to be well developed and has more complexity, so we let it as an implementation for 2nd phase.

###I PHASE:
- On the INTRO page all texts/descriptions about the db, modules and dependencies should be indexed from the main bio4j website, so no need to update, etc.
- LOCAL INFO very exhausted represented. This must be the focus.
- Global vision: static layout, not focus on it too much.
- Path drawing outside the graph?
- Ability of select cycles/communities by degree or... 

###II PHASE: 11 August
- All db modules integration
- Implementation: Automatized the queries on basic level, by defining a function that takes the indexes and parse them as they are needed on the Bio4j model.
- Implementation: Express somehow the quantity of data on nodes/links expected, like an order or magnitude.
- Implementation: Add the Search text box to browse the network.

- Implementation: intangible properties ---> if a relation exists, then that means many other will be, or not... choose a representative example of this
