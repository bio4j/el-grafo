## DATA STRUCTURE
All domain model info is stored in the **EDGES**, not in the nodes. NODES are just empty elements.

### HOW WE REPRESENT THE STRUCTURE?
List of characteristics/restrictions:

#### EDGES LABELS
1. In/Out-arity:   Many/One to Many/One --> 
    
    `` node.in(Label)  -> Option/List``

     `` node.out(Label) -> Option/List ``

2. Always defined/Not

    ``yes/no``

3. Local node things: locally unique.  Loops?

    ``yes/no``

4. Index & Sorted.
        Indexed by <some property>
        Sorted by <some property>
5. Groups

#### PROPERTY KEYS SHOULD HAVE:

### MODEL/REFERENCES
We are gonna start having a graph.json fragment of the domain model: the module references, as easiest to understand.
