# el grafo

1. input from the service in `.json`

## 1. get the model data in json from a service

You don something like `GET http://bio4j.com/model/go` and receive

``` json
{
  nodes: [
    ...
  ]
}
```

See bio4j/el-grafo#9.

## 2. adapt (if needed) the service data to graphlib

See [cpetit/graphlib](https://github.com/cpettitt/graphlib). We need directed graphs, and being able to store data at both edges and nodes. It looks like [Digraph](https://cpettitt.github.io/project/graphlib/latest/doc/index.html#Digraph) would suit our needs. The idea is that you just traverse the set of nodes and edges, adding them to a graphlib graph.

## 3. use the graphlib graph as input for dagre-d3

This should give us happiness in the form of something working.

## 4. link between the layout and the represented graph

We need to have a way of going from the layout elements to the represented data.

- `data <--> rep`

Right now dagre or dagre-d3 doesn't give you anything like that, but it is possible to hack something by iterating over the generated svg.

## 5. represent local information through user interaction on the graph representation

Examples

- properties of vertices/edges
- arity of relationships
- ...
