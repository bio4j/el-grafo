15. The best aspect of participating in GSoC is with no doubt the opportunity of learning lots of totally new things on the computer coding field while participating on an interesting, real, and useful project.

19. First I would like to congratulate the GSoC program as I think it is a really good initiative open to students all around the world.
About personal suggestions on how to improve the program, I think the GSoC Melange platform could be implemented from the students/mentors experience, in order to actually host all the work developed on each project, offering operative communication platforms for the team discussions, etc etc.
